kvarn is a granular synthesizer that samples live audio input from a contact microphone and a guitar pickup. the synthesis is controlled by two [pressure sensors](https://github.com/theleadingzero/embelashed/blob/master/hardware/paper-sensors/Pressure-sensor/pressure-instructions.md).

kvarn is powered by a [Bela](https://bela.io/) running Pure Data. this repository contains the pd patch.
